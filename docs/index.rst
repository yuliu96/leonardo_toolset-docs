Leonardo
=======

**A toolset to remove sample-induced aberrations in light sheet microscopy images**

:mod:`Leonardo` is an AI-empowered image processing toolbox that is able to resolve sample-induced 
aberrations for light-sheet fluorescence microscopy: (1) :mod:`Leonardo-DeStripe` removes the stripe artifacts caused by light absorption; 
(2) :mod:`Leonardo-FUSE` reconstructs one single high-quality image from dual-sided illumination and/or dual-sided detection while 
eliminating optical distortions (ghosts) caused by light refraction.
