# Leonardo: a toolset to remove sample-induced aberrations in light sheet microscopy images 

[![Build Status](https://github.com/peng-lab/leonardo_toolset/workflows/Build%20Main/badge.svg)](https://github.com/peng-lab/leonardo_toolset/actions)
---

*Leonardo* is a toolbox able to resolve all sample-induced aberrations in selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM, also called light-sheet fluorescence microscopy, LSFM) by using two major modules: (1) **DeStripe** removes the stripe artifacts caused by light absorption; (2) **Fuse** reconstructs one single high-quality image from dual-sided illumination and/or dual-sided detection while eliminating optical distortions (ghosts) caused by light refraction.

## Installation

**Stable Release:** `pip install leonardo_toolset`<br>
**Development Head:** `pip install git+https://github.com/peng-lab/leonardo_toolset.git`
